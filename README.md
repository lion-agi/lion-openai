## 🚀 Installation

lion-openai uses Poetry for dependency management. To install:

```bash
poetry add lion-openai
```

Or if you're using pip:

```bash
pip install lion-openai
```

## 👨‍💻 Development Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed.
2. Install Poetry:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lion-agi/lion-openai.git
   cd lion-openai
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
5. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

We use pytest for our test suite. To run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## 🧹 Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: For code formatting
- **isort**: For sorting imports
- **Flake8**: For style guide enforcement
- **mypy**: For static type checking

These tools are run automatically via pre-commit hooks before each commit. You can also run them manually:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 🛠 CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for our CI/CD pipeline. On every push and pull request:

- Tests are run
- Code quality checks are performed
- Documentation is built and deployed
